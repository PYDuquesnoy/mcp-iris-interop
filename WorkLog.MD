# WorkLog - MCP-IRIS-INTEROP Project

## Initial User Instruction
**Date:** 2025-07-07  
**User Request:** "run steps 1 to 3"

**Claude Decision:** Starting execution of Steps 1-3 as outlined in CLAUDE.md:
- Step 1: Create GitHub repository mcp-iris-interop
- Step 2: Clone and setup InterSystems IRIS dev template with fixed ports
- Step 3: Analyze VSCode plugin and create TypeScript prototype

**Implementation Plan:**
1. Create GitHub repository using gh CLI
2. Clone intersystems-iris-dev-template and modify for port 42000 range
3. Build and test IRIS container connectivity
4. Clone and analyze VSCode plugin source code
5. Create TypeScript prototype for IRIS namespace inventory

**Status:** Completed - Steps 1-3 finished successfully

## Step 3 Completion
**Date:** 2025-07-07  
**Deliverables:**
1. ✅ Complete VSCode plugin analysis (70+ API endpoints documented)
2. ✅ TypeScript prototype with full IRIS client functionality
3. ✅ Comprehensive curl test suite (7 scripts) validating all major APIs
4. ✅ Documentation and testing complete

**User Request:** "Document the added curl script and check in the code"

**Claude Decision:** Update README.MD with Step 3 completion, document curl test suite, and commit all changes to git.

**Status:** In Progress - Documenting and committing Step 3 deliverables

## Step 4 Request  
**Date:** 2025-07-07  
**User Request:** "Perform step 4, but also add the corresponding curl commands for me to be able to validate."

**Claude Decision:** Starting Step 4 implementation:
- Extend TypeScript prototype with class/package management
- Add upload, compile, download functionality
- Generate sample ObjectScript classes for testing
- Create corresponding curl validation commands
- Test against Docker IRIS instance

**Status:** Completed - Step 4 fully implemented and tested

## Step 4 Completion
**Date:** 2025-07-07  
**Deliverables:**
1. ✅ Extended TypeScript prototype with class management functionality
2. ✅ Implemented class/package inventory operations
3. ✅ Added upload class functionality with save and replace
4. ✅ Implemented compile class functionality (upload and compile)
5. ✅ Added download class and download package functionality
6. ✅ Generated sample ObjectScript classes for testing
7. ✅ Created comprehensive curl validation scripts including Step 4 validation
8. ✅ Successfully tested all functionality against Docker IRIS instance
9. ✅ Fixed upload format issues (discovered API expects {"enc": false, "content": [...]})
10. ✅ Updated project documentation and status tracking

**Implementation Notes:**
- Discovered critical upload format requirement: API expects {"enc": false, "content": [...]} not {"name": "...", "content": [...]}
- All 8 new class management commands working in TypeScript client
- Comprehensive curl test suite includes 09-step4-validation.sh for full workflow testing
- Upload, download, compilation, and package operations all validated

## Side Project Step 1 Request
**Date:** 2025-07-08  
**User Request:** "review generic instructions in Claude.md, current state of development in dev-status.md, and execute Step1 of side-project.md. The iris container is currently running (the docker-compose is in a subdirectory of this tree) with the namespaces %SYS and IRISAPP in place."

**Claude Decision:** Starting Side Project Step 1 implementation:
- Create separate "exec-proto" prototype for SQL stored procedure execution
- Reuse client-proto SQL execution capabilities (06-queries.sh)
- Implement ObjectScript stored procedure that can call classmethods
- Build TypeScript client for code execution via SQL
- Test against running IRIS Docker container
- Document and commit to GitHub

**Status:** Completed - exec-proto prototype fully functional

## Side Project Step 1 Completion
**Date:** 2025-07-08  
**Deliverables:**
1. ✅ Created exec-proto directory with complete ObjectScript execution prototype
2. ✅ Implemented ObjectScript classes with SqlProc methods 
3. ✅ Successfully uploaded and compiled classes to IRIS via Atelier REST API
4. ✅ Created SQL stored procedures using DDL for ObjectScript execution
5. ✅ Demonstrated remote ObjectScript execution via HTTP REST API calls
6. ✅ Proved client → REST API → SQL → Stored Procedure → ObjectScript architecture
7. ✅ Key discovery: SQL procedures without schema go to SQLUSER (User package)
8. ✅ Implemented working examples: simple test, calculations, dynamic code execution
9. ✅ Comprehensive testing scripts and validation
10. ✅ Complete documentation in exec-proto/README.md

**Implementation Notes:**
- Successfully created stored procedures callable as SQLUSER.ProcedureName()
- ObjectScript XECUTE command enables dynamic code execution within stored procedures
- TRY/CATCH error handling works in stored procedure ObjectScript code
- REST API /action/query endpoint supports stored procedure calls
- Prototype demonstrates foundation for MCP server integration

## Side Project Step 2 Completion
**Date:** 2025-07-08  
**Deliverables:**
1. ✅ Created Side.Mcp.Interop REST API class extending %CSP.REST
2. ✅ Implemented Side.Mcp.Deploy class with stored procedure deployment methods
3. ✅ Designed /side/mcp-interop REST API with comprehensive endpoints
4. ✅ Used %SYS.REST.DeployApplication for programmatic web app deployment
5. ✅ Implemented production listing functionality using Ens.Director.GetProductionSummary
6. ✅ Applied security authentication (user/password = value 32)
7. ✅ Created comprehensive testing and validation scripts
8. ✅ Integrated Ensemble/Interoperability detection capabilities
9. ✅ Demonstrated complete deployment automation via stored procedures
10. ✅ Validated architecture: Client → REST API → SQL → Stored Procedure → %SYS.REST.DeployApplication

**Implementation Notes:**
- REST API endpoints: /test, /status, /list, /productions for comprehensive interoperability
- Deployment automation through stored procedures enables programmatic web app creation
- Ens.Director integration provides production summary and status information
- Security value 32 enables user/password authentication for deployed web applications
- Complete Step 2 requirements fulfilled via stored procedure deployment approach
- Architecture extension proven: exec-proto now handles both execution AND deployment

**Combined Achievement:**
Both Step 1 (ObjectScript execution) and Step 2 (REST API deployment) complete, providing full foundation for MCP server integration with InterSystems IRIS interoperability capabilities.
